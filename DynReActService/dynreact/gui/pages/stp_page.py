Module stp_page

This is a proxy to the actual short term planning frontend, which is loaded dynamically.
If not specified otherwise, the delegate is taken from ../plugins/agentsPage.py, but if
the environment variable STP_FRONTEND is set to a module name, such as "dynreact.stp_gui.my_module"
(expecting a file "my_module.py"), then the proxy will try to load this module and retrieve a contained layout
field or function to which it delegates its own layout call.
